The goal of this project is to replicate research done by Narasimhan Jegadeesh (Emory University) and Di Wu (University of Michigan) [Deciphering Fedspeak: The Information Content of FOMC Meetings (2017)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2939937). The researchers analyze text from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes, from 1994 to 2015, by applying topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and regression modeling.
